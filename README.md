This Python code prompts the user to input a sequence of numbers separated by commas. It uses a while True loop to repeatedly ask for input until a valid sequence of numbers is provided. The input is then processed to create a list of floating-point numbers using a list comprehension and the split method.

If the input contains any non-numeric characters or is improperly formatted, a ValueError exception is caught, and an error message is displayed. Otherwise, if the input is valid, the loop is exited using the break statement.

After successfully obtaining a valid sequence of numbers, the code sorts the numbers in ascending order using the sorted function. Finally, it prints the sorted list of numbers along with a descriptive message.
